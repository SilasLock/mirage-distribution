# Simulating the Mirage Distribution
Part of the work on quantal response dashboards.

In this repository, we're going to be simulating how prices change the mirage distribution for a given value distribution.

Running the simulation is performed by navigating to the project directory in a terminal and running the command

```
Julia simulation-script.jl
```

To do this, you'll first need to install Julia. Go to the [Julia downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release) and select the download type corresponding to your operating system. During the installation process, select the option to add Julia to the path. Once the process is complete, you should be able to run the simulation from your preferred terminal emulator.

For basics on the Julia language, see the [getting started page](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/).
